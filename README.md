what u need to do is make a new bookmark

Add the code, (javascript:document.body.contentEditable = 'true'; document.designMode='on'; void 0) DONT COPY THE BRACKETS and copy to the browser
Now what you want to do is click it on the page u want to inspect, and there we go, you can inspect the page and change any detail you want it to.
